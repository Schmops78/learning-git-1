# Git Basics

* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder

* `git status` - I can use this anytime to see the current status of the repository

* `git add <file>' - places the file in the git staging area

* `git commit` - commits the file into git repository. this was modified

* `git diff` - tells the difference between file and what is stored in the git repository

* `git log` - tells you the log history of your commits
